Which OPT Feature tags does your current browser support?

If the OPT feature is supported “N” will be replaced with “Y”. Made with OPT so that it is the actual OPT features you are testing — not an interpretation of them. WARNING! If you are using Safari it is lying to you. Safari doesnt care what you set your css to.
